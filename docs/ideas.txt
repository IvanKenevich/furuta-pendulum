Furuta project ideas
====================

- Test effects of setting theta1 error to 0 (recovery angle, disturbance rejection, stability)

- -|-| of ignoring inductance (same)

- -|-| of simplifying inertial tensor matrices (principal axes + same inertia in yy and zz)

- State space vs classical

- Non-linear controller (compare performance to linear)

- Investigate parameter optimization via controllability Grammian (specifically, changing arm2 mass)

- Kalman filter vs secant line (different length of secant)

- Investigate more accurate / different ways of measuring motor parameters

- Investigate why current matters for furuta but not RWIP

- Investigate why inductance seems to matter so much (diff between controllable and not)
	Suggestion: look at the magnitudes of torques/delta Is/whatever that are caused by the current state variable

- (RWIP) Frequency response of the entire state space system
  Obtain ss coefficients in the upside down position then flip the signs to predict ss in the upside down orientation

- Model predictive control

- Use optimization and test data to optimize model parameters
