Furuta project ideas
====================

0. Commit code changes that we made today on the school computer

- Test effects of setting theta1 error to 0 (recovery angle, disturbance rejection, stability)

- -|-| of ignoring inductance (same)

- -|-| of simplifying inertial tensor matrices (principal axes + same inertia in yy and zz)

- State space vs classical

- Non-linear controller (compare performance to linear)

- Investigate parameter optimization via controllability Grammian (specifically, changing arm2 mass)

- Kalman filter vs secant line (different length of secant)

-
