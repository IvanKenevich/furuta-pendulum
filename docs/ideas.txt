Furuta project ideas
====================

control algos
-------------
- State space vs classical
- State space with integrator
- Model predictive control
- Non-linear controller (compare performance to linear)

estimators
----------
- Kalman filter vs secant line (different length of secant)
- Current estimation sucks (typo? try Kalman?)
- Investigate why current matters for furuta but not RWIP
- Investigate why inductance seems to matter so much (diff between controllable and not)
	Suggestion: look at the magnitudes of torques/delta Is/whatever that are caused by the current state variable

tuning
------
- Test effects of setting theta1 error to 0 (recovery angle, disturbance rejection, stability)
- Test effects of ignoring inductance (same)
- Test effects of simplifying inertial tensor matrices (principal axes + same inertia in yy and zz)
- Investigate parameter optimization via controllability Grammian (specifically, changing arm2 mass)

mechanical
----------
- Dual motor system (one with high torque and backlash, other with low torque no backlash, have benefits of both)
  (MIMO or logical switch to choose which motor to use and how much)
- Better bearing for arm2
- More rigid mounting to shaft for arm2

sys id
------
- Investigate more accurate / different ways of measuring motor parameters
- (RWIP) Frequency response of the entire state space system
  Obtain ss coefficients in the upside down position then flip the signs to predict ss in the upside down orientation
- Use optimization and test data to optimize model parameters
- Learn how to model nonlinearities (backlash, friction)
